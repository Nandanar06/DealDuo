For a local user . . .
First, clone the code from this Github repository

UPDATES
Initially, our endeavor involved comparing prices between Amazon and Flipkart. However, our efforts were impeded by automated bots preventing access to these platforms. Subsequently, we shifted focus to eBay and Etsy for comparison purposes. While eBay yielded positive results, accessing Etsy posed challenges, particularly when utilizing Beautiful Soup. Consequently, we opted to employ Selenium within Flask and experimented with Chromium, albeit without success. Despite employing various debugging techniques such as multithreading and rerouting, we were unable to resolve the issues encountered with Etsy. Additionally, accessing the API developer key proved problematic, as obtaining permission from higher authorities typically requires more than a day's time. We have already submitted our request for approval and await confirmation. Moving forward, our strategy includes integrating Etsy along with other e-commerce platforms in the near future.
